## Team-Profile-Generator
# Challenge #10 - Week 10:

# Project Description
### What is this project?
For this weeks project I am tasked to develop a functional HTML Team generator! This is to be used by a manager who wants to develop a visually appealing team card generator! Taking advantage of recent OOP classes and TDD files I have developed a generator where a manager develops there card as well as other team members. This application will display a series of questions for the user to answer inside their console/terminal. After the manager is happy with their input they can select "Done!" in the terminal and a populated index.html file will be generated inside the dist folder.
