## Team-Profile-Generator
# Challenge #10 - Week 10:

# Project Description
### What is this project?
For this weeks project I am tasked to develop a functional HTML Team generator! This is to be used by a manager who wants to develop a visually appealing team card generator! Taking advantage of my Node.js knowledge, recent OOP classes and TDD files I have developed a generator where a manager develops a webpage that displays their teams basic information. This application will display a series of questions for the user to answer inside their console/terminal. After the manager is happy with their input they can select "Done!" in the terminal and a populated index.html file will be generated inside the dist folder. 

### Files modified
For this project I been required to create an abundant amount of files for this project to be successful. Involving the following:

### Challenges
For this project I had faced numerous challenges. A major hurdle that I ensured was the rendering of the cards. This took a significant amount of my time where I struggled to pass the information and have that information displayed properly for the generateHTML.js file. Originally it would only paste the object text itself filled with divs and functions. After lots of trial and error, constant syntax changes and restructuring, I managed to fix the application for rendering the cards. Next challenge was understanding how to tackle jest, the test.js files. I avoided this for last because I didn't know how to tackle it originally. This was an area that I wasn't knowledgable on, however, in the end I managed to develop simple test situations. Additionally throughout the making of this application, I saw several syntax errors, this is definitely an area that I will need to consistently practice on!
